# AR_Drumkit
Final project for Augmented Reality module in Trinity College Dublin. \
Drum kit viewable on a phone

Developed an augmented reality (AR) platform on Unity (DrumView) that enables drummers and enthusiasts to view and customise drum kits to 
their preferences. The platform offers users the ability to choose drum components and move each part independently, 
creating a custom setup that meets their needs.
